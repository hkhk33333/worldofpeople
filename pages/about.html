                <p>
                    "World of People" is a global initiative that aims to highlight our shared human experience
                    through authentic conversations with people from all walks of life and corners of the globe.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    To foster empathy and connection by revealing how, despite our different backgrounds,
                    we all face similar struggles, joys, and questions in life.
                </p>
                
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>
                    We approach strangers in different countries and ask them personal questions about their
                    lives, challenges, hopes, and perspectives. These candid moments are captured
                    on video to create a global tapestry of human experience.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Join the Movement</h3>
                <p>
                    Soon, you'll be able to participate by conducting your own interviews or sharing your
                    own stories. Together, we can build a platform that celebrates our common humanity.
